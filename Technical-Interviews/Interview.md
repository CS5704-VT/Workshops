## Technical Interview Workshop

Complete the following activities for the workshop. Make sure to read all of the instructions for details on what to submit for this assignment.

1. Find a partner
2. There will be two rounds of mock interviews. Each round should last approximately 30 minutes.
3. After each round, there will be a post-interview survey and assessment for each student to complete
4. You must complete the mock interview in a non-programming environment either in-person or virtually over Zoom and submit _a recording of your interview_ [on Canvas](https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/165661/assignments/1738079).
   1. For virtual, submit audio and video recording of your think-aloud and screenshare of solving the problem on a whiteboard or non-IDE environment
   2. For in-person, you will need to submit video recordings that contain your audible speech and a visible representation of your code. Submit your problem solution (picture or screenshot) with your submission.
5. Switch places
6. **[Optional]:** Check out this [research survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe7L3EqSmjMyruDkq5sUNjsjNeQqMJIHUjwOoKK8p3OFCIFrA/viewform) that seeks to understand how candidates prepare for technical interviews!

### Round 1

The student who's last name comes first alphabetically is the interviewer, the other student is the candidate.

The interviewer will select a problem for the candidate to complete from [here](https://seanprashad.com/leetcode-patterns/). The problem should not be known by your partner ahead of time and they may use the programming language of their choice or pseudocode. Verbally explain the coding question to the candidate, clarifying any questions about the problem to the best of your knowledge or based on the solution. 

Then, the partner acting as a candidate should begin coding. Additionally, candiates should perform a think aloud during problem-solving to describe their approach. This is an important part of a technical interview. Some questions you should answer during coding can include:

    What is your approach?
    What are you currently thinking about?
    Is there a better way to do this?
    Are there any edge cases you are missing?

Interviewers should keep track of how long candidates spend on the problem (_use a timer_) and pay attention to provide feedback on their partners' communication and technical abilities. If the candidate does not seem like they will be able to solve the question, end the interview and work together to come up with a possible solution.

**Assessments**

After the 30 minutes is up, interviewers should share their feedback with the candidate. Then, take the time to complete these surveys based on your specific role for this round:

* [Interviewer, Round 1](https://forms.gle/t1v8dxaThiSihywPA)
* [Candidate, Round 1](https://forms.gle/sxKdxf3naxqfoBdV8)

### Round 2

Now, the interviewer and candidate should switch roles. Repeat the steps above with a different problem to complete a mock interview.

**Assessments**

After 30 minutes is up, interviewers should provide feedback to the candidate on their programming and think aloud performance. Then, complete the following surveys for your role in Round 2:

* [Interviewer, Round 2](https://forms.gle/iR6R2uvhX11ELbW98)
* [Candidate, Round 2](https://forms.gle/2mFxhp2qGkeUuQmr6)

### 📝 Complete the assessment forms and upload your recordings [to Canvas](https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/165661/assignments/1738079/). Due: Friday, March 3 at 11:59pm

> This workshop is based on the Interview Workshop by Dr. Chris Parnin.
