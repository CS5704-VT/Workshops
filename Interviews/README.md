# Technical Interview Workshop

Software engineers are primarily evaluated and hired through _technical interviews_, a process where job-seeking candidates solve programming problems by writing code or pseudocode in front of potential employers while simultaneously communicating their thought process and strategy through think-alouds. While there are many problems with this approach, technical interviews are currently the industry standard. For this workshop, you will gain experience practicing this process by conducting a mock interview with another student in class. This activity should be treated as a real technical interview, and you should try to come up with the most optimal and efficient solutions possible.

**Due: Friday, April 22 at 11:59pm**
