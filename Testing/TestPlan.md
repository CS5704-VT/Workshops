# Test Plans

A test plan is a detailed document that outlines test cases for a given software system. Test cases are the functionalities and/or features to test in a software system. A good test plan has the following properties:

* Repeatable: able to be replicated by other developers on the team
* Specific: descriptive steps to follow
* Focused: Each test should only analyze one particular function of the system

Black box test plans are documents that use plain language for stakeholders (other developers, independent testers, or even clients) to follow to verify the program. The following activity will allow you to gain practice writing a black box testing plan.

## üìù Activity

For this activity, you must create a black box testing plan with your partner. Your testing plan must contain at least _six_ unique black box testing cases with all of the required test case information (see the [Lecture Slides](https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/145256/files/22374735?module_item_id=1849298)). If your partner is in your project group, write a test plan for how you would evaluate your course project. Otherwise, select one of the examples from the [Project Ideas](https://github.com/CS5704-VT/Course/blob/main/Project/IDEAS.md). You may use the template provided in the lecture slides or come up with your own.

After creating a draft of your test plan, trade plans with another team. Both teams should provide feedback on the others' black box testing plan document based on the lecture materials and the criteria above. Be sure to include details about the test plan in your evaluation (i.e. what is good, how it can be improved, etc.). 

In your document to submit, add who you worked with and a brief description of the program your testing plan is for at the beginning along with the test cases, the names of the reviewers of the document, and a short summary of their feedback on your test plan document. You will work with your partner to create the test plan, however _each person should add the test plan to their individual Canvas HW5 submission_ (can be the exact same copy).
