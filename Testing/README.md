Testing is the process of executing a program (executing code or behavioral tasks) to find errors prior to delivering software to end users. This workshop consists of various activities to gain skills related to testing in software engineering. You may work with a partner or small group to complete the workshop in class. **_Only the first activity has something to submit!_ You will receive full credit for the workshop as long as you put forth a reasonable effort in all of the activities.** Please reach out to the instructor if you have any questions or run into any problems.
