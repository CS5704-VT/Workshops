# Requirements and Design Workshop

This workshop will provide an overview of requirements and design concepts discussed in class. Please read the instructions carefully. You will need to complete the following activities and upload your responses as a .txt or .pdf file, or input your responses directly, on Canvas to submit for Homework 2.

## Requirements and Design

Read through the example bot and application [project ideas](https://github.com/CS5704-VT/Course/blob/main/Project/IDEAS.md). Select one that you might want to work on *__other than__* the Standup Bot discussed in class. Complete the following activities for both of the proposed programs.

1. Describe the problem:
        What is the problem each problem is trying to solve?
        Why is it a problem worth solving? Or why not?
2. Provide an example of three hypothetical non-functional requirements for this system.
3. Think of a specific task required to complete this project. Estimate the amount of effort to complete this task using function points (using the values here). Briefly explain your answer.
4. Write two user stories from the perspective of two different actors. Provide the acceptance criteria for these stories.
5. Describe which architectural pattern you would use to structure the system. Justify your answer.
6. Discuss which design pattern family might be helpful for implementing this project. Justify your answer.

## HCI Scavenger Hunt 
Human-computer interaction (HCI) is a broad research field that seeks to improve how humans interact with technology, and encompasses a variety of software design concepts such as user interfaces (UI), user experience (UX), and user-cented design (UCD). However, many software applications today still incorporate ineffective, unusable, and non-intuitive interface designs leading to frustration for users. For this task, find an example of *__two__* poorly designed software interfaces. If possible, provide a screenshot or picture of the design with an explanation of why you find the interfaces poorly designed and discuss how interface design processes (storyboarding, wireframes, or flow maps) can help the UI be improved.
