# Project Metrics

It has been approximately a 2-week sprint since the lightning talk presentations for the project. For the following activity, you will provide an update on your project based on the of metrics to analyze code and team productivity discussed in the lecture so far. Use your project GitHub repository or code base to answer the questions below (for #1). If you do not yet have a repository set up for your, please explain why you haven't started yet and select a random public project on GitHub.

## [Code]

1. Select one module (method, function, etc.) in your program. Calculate the cyclomatic complexity of that module.

2. Select a different module in your program. Calculate the Lines of Code for that module.
   
3. For any module in your program, provide an example of distinct _operators_ and distinct _operands_ that would be used to calculate Halstead's complexity metric.

4. If you are using an object-oriented approach (and have made enough progress on the project code), calculate one of the OO specific metrics for a class (WMC, depth, number of children, number of sublcasses, etc.)

## [Process]

5. What has your velocity been for the first ~2 week sprint? 

6. How satisfied are you with your team's velocity and progress on the project so far (answer in terms of cumulative flow, burndown, and/or fault slippage)?

7. Are there any tasks that are currently blocked? If so, what is the blocked time and how do you plan to overcome the blocker.

## [General]

8. There are approximately 9 weeks until the project repository is due. How do you plan to complete the remaining tasks?

9. You are required to use an issue tracking system for your project. Which platform is your team using?

10. Please share a link to the repository used to answer these questions.

**Submit:** You may work with your project teammates on this activity, but each student must submit the responses individually. Please add the names of any other students you worked with to your document and upload to the [Canvas assignment](https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/165661/assignments/1747227) _before the end of class_.
