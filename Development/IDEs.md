# Integrated Development Environments

Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) enable software engineers to complete various activities related to writing a computer program. IDEs often provide a variety of features to support software development, including syntax highlighting, autocomplete, static analysis tools, debugging functionality, refactoring, multiple language support, integrations with git, code searching, and more...

Originally, software engineers wrote program code using [punch cards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punched_card) in languages such as FORTRAN. Before the modern coding editors and cloud-based IDES, software engineers wrote code using editors in the console or terminal. One example is `vi`, an open source terminal-based development environment referred to as "[the programmer's editor](https://www.vim.org/about.php)".
